Greetings! My name is Zhaoxun "Lorenz" Liu. 

I am a **Team Lead in Machine Learning** at <a href="https://temertysimcentre.com/surgical-artificial-intelligence-research-academy-sara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SARA Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.uhn.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University Health Network (UHN)</a>. 

My interests lie in **interdisciplinary machine learning**, particularly its applications in **healthcare** and **human-computer interaction**. Specifically: 
* AI in Healthcare: I develop machine learning solutions to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes, focusing on integrating AI systems seamlessly into healthcare workflows.
* Human-AI Interaction: I apply my expertise in HCI & AI to build interactive systems and study their impact on users.
* Human-Centered AI: I search for methods to control AI behaviors and align them with human values and goals.

I am an alumnus of the **[Master of Science in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/)** at the **[Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/)**, Class of '25.

For leisure, I play the cello and cook.
